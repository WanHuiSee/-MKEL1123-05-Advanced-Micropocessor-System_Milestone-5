<br>Online Application/Software used in this project:
  1. Edge Impulse to train the data model
     <br>(Sign up for free at [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/))
  2. STM32CubeIDE to deploy trained model into microcontroller board
     <br>(Download and install from [Integrated Development Environment for STM32](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html))
  3. PuTTY to display test result
     <br>(Download and install from [Download PuTTY: latest release (0.77)](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html))

<br>Step to build and train data model from Edge Impulse:
  1. The image dataset used was obtained and downloaded from Kaggle
     <br>(Link:[Fire Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atulyakumar98/test-dataset?resource=download)(
  2. The dateset was then uploaded to Edge Impulse through the uploader. On "Dashboard", select "LET'S COLLECT SOME DATA".
