<br>Online Application/Software used in this project:
  1. Edge Impulse to train the data model
     <br>(Sign up for free at [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/))
  2. STM32CubeIDE to deploy trained model into microcontroller board
     <br>(Download and install from [Integrated Development Environment for STM32](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html))
  3. PuTTY to display test result
     <br>(Download and install from [Download PuTTY: latest release (0.77)](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html))

<br>Step to build and train data model from Edge Impulse:
  1. The image dataset used is obtained and downloaded from Kaggle
     <br>(Link:[Fire Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atulyakumar98/test-dataset?resource=download)(
  2. The dateset is then uploaded to Edge Impulse through the uploader. On "Dashboard", select "LET'S COLLECT SOME DATA".

  3. Choose "Upload data" and click "Go to the uploader".

  4. In "Data acquisition" section, the "Choose Files" button is clicked and a total of 100 images are selected to upload into Edge Impulse. "Automatically split between training and testing" as a ratio of training data to testing data is selected under "Upload into category" section which can help in archieving high accuracy in the training phase later. Then, "Infer from filename" is chosen and clicked "Begin Upload".

  5. After all images are successfully uploaded, go to "Create Impulse" under "Impulse design", the impulse is created according to the image below and clicked on "Save Impulse".

  6. Next, go to "Image" in "Impulse design" section, RGB is selected as Color Depth Parameter and clicked on "Save Parameter".

  7. Once the parameter is saved, click "Generate features" button then both Raw and Processed features are generated and will be used in Model Training phase.

  8. In "NN Classifier" section, the values for  "Number of training cycles", "Learning rate", "Validation set size" to configure the Neural Network architecture are set as figure below and start training. Once the training process is done, the validation accuracy of the model in Model Training phase is shown and at the same time the best preforming model is saved and quantized into 8 bit fixed point model together with the inputs and outputs of that model.

  9. Then, click the "Classify all" button in "Model testing" section and prediction on testing datasets is made by the best performing model and the testing accuracy is shown.

  10. Lastly, go to "Deployment" section and select "Cube.MX CMSIS-PACK" and make sure the EON Compiler is enabled before click the "Build" button. Once the "Build" button has been clicked, the PACK file is downloaded, which will be used in the STM32CubeIDE.
